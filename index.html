                <h3>Wash your place</h3>
                <p>While research into the COVID-19 virus is ongoing, we know the virus is spread mainly when respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing, sneezing, talking, singing) get into the mouth, nose or eyes of people who are nearby. We also now know that people can be infected, and spread the virus to others, even without having any symptoms. People may also become infected by touching their mouth, nose or eyes after touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The virus may survive on surfaces for a few hours up to several days. The good news? Simple disinfectants can kill it.</p>

                <h3>Maintain Distance</h3>
            	<p>Physical distancing helps limit the spread of COVID-19 – this means we keep a distance of at least 1m from each other and avoid spending time in crowded places or in groups.Protect yourself and others.​ Break the chain of transmission.Maintain distance</h3>
                That’s why it’s important to stay home and practice physical distancing. If we must go out, e.g. to buy groceries or for medical reasons, we should stay at least 1m away from others.Limiting gatherings with people outside your household – like group activities and religious events – can reduce the spread of COVID-19.​Protect yourself and others. Do your part. Stay home.</p>

            <h3>Don't touch face</h3>
            <p>To help prevent infections, keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Why? These mucous membranes are a portal of entry for germs that cause respiratory infections, including COVID-19.It is estimated that people touch their face about 23 times per hour! Respiratory infections can be caused by many different bacteria and viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19. When you touch your face, the germs on your hands can take up residence in your mucous membranes and cause infections, including COVID-19 infections.We can then infect ourselves with those germs by touching our face.</p>

                <h3>Wash your hand</h3>
                <p>Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can help stop germs from spreading from one person to another and in our communities—including your home, workplace, schools, and childcare facilities.Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.There may be other key times when it is important to wash hands during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                <h3>Use napkin</h3>
                <p>As the world is going to observe the Menstrual Hygiene Day on Thursday, millions of women in India are being forced to search for alternatives, including unhygienic options, due to coronavirus lockdown.With schools shut down,free supplies of "sanitary napkins" by the government have come to a halt, forcing teenage girls to use dirty pieces of cloth and rags.But what shocked many was that sanitary napkins, used for female hygiene, were not included in the "essential services". Many women’s groups, doctors and non-governmental organizations came forward highlighting that COVID-19 will not stop menstrual cycles.</p>

                <h3>wer a mask</h3>
                <p>Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work.Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. </p>

If this is not possible, then they should have a designated part of the home and their movements around the house should be limited.</p>
